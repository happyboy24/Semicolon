/*ask the user to enter a number.
store this value in a variable called number.
check the number if number is 0:
print "zero".
else if number is greater than 0:
if number is divisible by 2 (the remainder of number divided by 2 is 0):
print number followed by " is a positive even number".
else (it's not even):
print number followed by " is a positive odd number".
else if number is less than 0:
if number is divisible by 2 (the remainder of number divided by 2 is 0):
print number followed by " is a negative even number".
